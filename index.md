## Experience

### `Freelance` Preliminary researcher / Solution advisor / Consultant

Some of the work was to advise on containerization strategies and to apply decided strategies on development and run-time environments with vastly different technological choices on topics surrounding; TypeScript, React, Java, gradle/maven, Javascript, ssr, spa, pwa, webpack (and Module Federation), ecosystem’s own (typescript, react, etc..) transpilers, babel, yarn (v2 e.i. Berry), and others.  
        The paragraph above is a short (but key-word intensive) summary of many projects/specific implementations regarding technical portions of mostly DevOps, Continuous Integration and Delivery topics.

Others were more advisory on wide-range of problems and their unique solutions with careful consideration of both current scale and future scalability.

* Researching for relevant solutions, even the edge cases of feasibility.
* Presentation and clarification of each potential solutions’ costs and benefits
* Taking part in making the decision for the solution.

* Some projects also include different stages
